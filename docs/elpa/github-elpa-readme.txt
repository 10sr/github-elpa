github-elpa is an Emacs command-line utility to build your own
package.el-compatible package repository in your git repository.
By default this repository will be built into docs/elpa directory,
so by just pushing it to GitHub you can publish the repository with
GitHub Pages.

This package is mainly intended to be used from Cask.
See https://github.com/10sr/github-elpa for usage guide.
