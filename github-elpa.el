;;; Commentary:

;; github-elpa is an Emacs command-line utility to build your own
;; package.el-compatible package repository in your git repository.
;; By default this repository will be built into docs/elpa directory,
;; so by just pushing it to GitHub you can publish the repository with
;; GitHub Pages.

;; This package is mainly intended to be used from Cask.
;; See https://github.com/10sr/github-elpa for usage guide.
